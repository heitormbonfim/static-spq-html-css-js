# static "single page application"
- A static page "single page application" using only html, css and javascript. (  made it thinking about github pages )

- You can run it locally just by opening the file "index.html" inside the project directory.

- If you reload it in another "page" like "About" for example, it will return to the Home Page, since there's no routes like "*index.html/home"
  or "index.html/about"
